(* From the prologue:
 * 
 * "An interesting aspect of supervising students from a
 * wide range of backgrounds (some with no previous experience
 * at all taking Computer Science as an additional subject within
 * the Cambridge Natural Sciences curriculum, and some with a great
 * deal of programming experience already) is the level playing field
 * which the ML family of languages (like OCaml) provide. Sometimes,
 * those students with least prior programming experience perform the best."
 *
 * "I would urge you to consider the possibility that, at the moment,
 * you might be the boy holding down the space bar."
