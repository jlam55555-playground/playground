Files:

-----
bochsrc.txt: configuration file for Bochs

You may have to change the location of the romimage and vgaromimage depending
on the bochs installation. See bochs(1).

This emulates an IA32 machine 32MB with a slowed down CPU.

-----
Makefile: the Makefile

Orchestrates compilation and linkage of the source files into the kernel image.
Compiles using NASM rather than GNU as.

-----
Link.ld: configuration script for the GNU ld linker

Tells the linker that the start location of the binary should be the
"start", the .text section should go first and begin at 0x100000 (1MB).
The .data and .bss should be next and page-aligned. We bundle in the
.rodata region with the data region for simplicity.

-----
update_image.sh: copies the kernel binary into the floppy image file

-----
run_bochs.sh: run the kernel using bochs

-----
boot.s: initial boot code

Most of this file involves setting up the Multiboot header. Multiboot is a
standard for boot sequences.
