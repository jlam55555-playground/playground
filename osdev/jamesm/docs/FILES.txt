bochsrc.txt: configuration file for Bochs

You may have to change the location of the romimage and vgaromimage depending
on the bochs installation. See bochs(1).

This emulates an IA32 machine 32MB with a slowed down CPU.

To make this work with the latest version of bochs (2.6.11), I had to take out
the BIOS start address[1] and change the IPS to 1000000 (the minimum allowed
by this version).

Makefile: the Makefile

Orchestrates compilation and linkage of the source files into the kernel image.
Compiles using NASM rather than GNU as.

An extra cc flag has to be added to compile in i386 rather than the default
(x86_64).

-----
Link.ld: configuration script for the GNU ld linker

Tells the linker that the start location of the binary should be the
"start", the .text section should go first and begin at 0x100000 (1MB).
The .data and .bss should be next and page-aligned. We bundle in the
.rodata region with the data region for simplicity.

boot.s: initial boot code

Most of this file involves setting up the Multiboot header. Multiboot is a
standard for boot sequences.
